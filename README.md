### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Julio! 

I've been in the IT sector for a couple of years, I made this Github repository to have projects with which I have learned to use web technologies and that serve me as a library or cheat sheets, to remember some software implementations I did before or to have templates to start new projects from scratch.

A little bit about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with Angular (honestly I prefer React.js more).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Node.js
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Full Stack projects using Node.js, React or Java 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can contact me through linkedin, the link is at the top of my profile!
- âš¡ Fun fact: When I had my first approach to a computer in the 90s, I learned to use it while playing super nintendo with emulators. And then I improved my typing speed while playing online games and typing simultaneously in chat with other players. I tried to take formal typing classes on my own, but I couldn't unlearn the way I used it, maybe if I had taken them in the beginning, I would be even faster at programming, lol
