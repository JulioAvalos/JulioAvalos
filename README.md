# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

**My name is Julio, and I'm a software engineer with over 10 years of experience!**  

Iâ€™ve been in the IT sector for quite some time. When I first started my journey in this fast-paced industry, I created this GitHub account to store a large repository of my projects. These projects have helped me learn web technologies and now serve as a personal libraryâ€”a place to reference past implementations or reuse templates for starting new projects from scratch.  

## A little bit about me:

- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working with Angular**, but Iâ€™m also highly experienced with **React.js** and **Next.js**!  
- ðŸ“« **How to reach me:**  
  - Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julioavalos2/) (link at the top of my profile).  
  - Or send me an email!  
- âš¡ **Fun fact:**  
  My first encounter with a computer in the 90s was through playing Super Nintendo games on emulators. I improved my typing speed by chatting with other players in online games.
  
  I even tried formal typing classes later, but I couldnâ€™t unlearn my unique typing style. Maybe if Iâ€™d started with those classes, Iâ€™d be even faster now!
