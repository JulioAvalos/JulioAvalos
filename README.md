# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

**My name is Julio, and I'm a seasoned software engineer with over 10 years of experience!**  

Iâ€™ve been in the IT sector for quite some time, specializing in developing and programming enterprise applications for both internal and public-facing use. Throughout my career, I have worked across various industries, including digital agencies, food franchises, logistics, e-commerce, and banking, gaining a broad understanding of diverse business environments.

When I first started my journey in this fast-paced industry, I created this GitHub account to store a large repository of my projects. These projects have helped me learn web technologies and now serve as a personal libraryâ€”a place to reference past implementations or reuse templates for starting new projects from scratch.

My technical expertise spans multiple technologies such as **jQuery**, **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **C#**, **PHP**, **Angular**, **Node.js**, **React**, **Next.js**, **Docker**, **Git**, **Oracle SQL**, **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **Google Cloud Platform**, and **Amazon Web Services**. Over the past five years, Iâ€™ve specialized in **Java/Spring Boot**, **Node.js**, and **React.js/Next.js**, delivering scalable and efficient solutions tailored to modern business needs.

## A little bit about me:

- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working with Angular**, but Iâ€™m also highly experienced with **React.js** and **Next.js**!  
- ðŸ“« **How to reach me:**  
  - Connect with me on [LinkedIn](#) (link at the top of my profile).  
  - Or send me an email!  
- âš¡ **Fun fact:**  
  My first encounter with a computer in the 90s was through playing Super Nintendo games on emulators. I improved my typing speed by chatting with other players in online games.  
  I even tried formal typing classes later, but I couldnâ€™t unlearn my unique typing style.  
  Maybe if Iâ€™d started with those classes, Iâ€™d be even faster now!
