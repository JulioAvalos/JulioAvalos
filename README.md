# Hi there! 👋

I'm **Julio**, a senior **software engineer** with over a decade of experience designing, building, and scaling enterprise applications.

Throughout my career, I’ve had the privilege of working in **digital agencies**, **food franchises**, **logistics**, **e-commerce**, and **banking**, which has provided me with a diverse perspective on business environments and the distinct challenges they face. 

I first created this GitHub account to store and showcase a wide array of projects that helped me learn and master web technologies. Over the years, these projects have become a personal library, a valuable reference for past implementations and templates to kick-start new ventures.

### Technical Expertise 💻

With a strong foundation in both backend and frontend technologies, I bring expertise in the following:

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, React Native, Angular, jQuery, JavaScript, TypeScript, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, Elixir, PHP, C#
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, MongoDB
- **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS, GCP, Docker, Git, Jenkins, SonarQube
- **AI tools**: Claude Code, Github Copilot, Chat GPT

### A Little Bit About Me

- 🔭 **Currently working with**: Java, Spring Boot, React.js, Github Copilot & Claude Code!
- 📫 **How to reach me**: Connect with me on [LinkedIn](#) or send me an email!
- ⚡ **Fun fact**: My first encounter with computers was in the 90s, playing **Super Nintendo games** on emulators. I improved my typing speed by chatting with other players in online games. I even tried formal typing classes later, but I couldn’t unlearn my unique typing style. Who knows? Maybe if I’d started those classes earlier, I’d be an even faster typist now!
