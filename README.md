My name is Julio, and I'm a software engineer with over 10 years of experience!

Iâ€™ve been in the IT sector for quite some time. When I first started my journey in this fast-paced industry, I created this GitHub account to store a large repository of my projects. These projects have helped me learn web technologies and now serve as a personal libraryâ€”a place to reference past implementations or reuse templates for starting new projects from scratch.

A little bit about me:

    ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with Angular, but Iâ€™m also highly experienced with React.js and Next.js!
    ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can contact me through LinkedIn (the link is at the top of my profile) or send me an email!
    âš¡ Fun fact: My first encounter with a computer in the 90s was through playing Super Nintendo games on emulators. I improved my typing speed by chatting with other players in online games. I even tried formal typing classes later, but I couldnâ€™t unlearn my unique typing style. Maybe if Iâ€™d started with those classes, Iâ€™d be even faster now!
