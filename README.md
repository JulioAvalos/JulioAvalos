# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

**My name is Julio, and Iâ€™m a highly skilled and results-driven software engineer with over a decade of experience!**

I specialize in developing and programming enterprise applications for both internal and public-facing use. Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work across various industries, including digital agencies, food franchises, logistics, e-commerce, and banking. This has provided me with a deep understanding of diverse business environments and their unique challenges.

When I first started my journey in this fast-paced industry, I created this GitHub account to store a large repository of my projects. These projects have helped me learn web technologies and now serve as a personal libraryâ€”a place to reference past implementations or reuse templates for starting new projects from scratch.

With a robust technical foundation, I bring expertise in a wide range of technologies, including **jQuery**, **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **C#**, **PHP**, **Angular**, **Node.js**, **React**, **Next.js**, **Docker**, **Git**, **Oracle SQL**, **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **Google Cloud Platform**, and **Amazon Web Services**. Over the past five years, Iâ€™ve focused on **Java/Spring Boot**, **Node.js**, and **React.js/Next.js**, delivering scalable, efficient, and innovative solutions that align with modern business needs.

I pride myself on being a strong technical leader, capable of tackling complex challenges and driving projects to success through hard work, dedication, and collaboration. I am committed to delivering high-quality products that meet and exceed client expectations. My passion for continuous learning and adapting to new technologies ensures I stay at the forefront of industry trends, enabling me to consistently deliver exceptional results.

## A little bit about me:

- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working with Angular**, but Iâ€™m also highly experienced with **React.js** and **Next.js**!  
- ðŸ“« **How to reach me:**  
  - Connect with me on [LinkedIn](#) (link at the top of my profile).  
  - Or send me an email!  
- âš¡ **Fun fact:**  
  My first encounter with a computer in the 90s was through playing Super Nintendo games on emulators. I improved my typing speed by chatting with other players in online games.  
  I even tried formal typing classes later, but I couldnâ€™t unlearn my unique typing style.  
  Maybe if Iâ€™d started with those classes, Iâ€™d be even faster now!
