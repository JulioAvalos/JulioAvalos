### A Little Bit About Me

- 🔭 **Currently working with**: Angular, but also highly experienced with **React.js** and **Next.js**!
- 📫 **How to reach me**: Connect with me on [LinkedIn](#) or send me an email!
- ⚡ **Fun fact**: My first encounter with computers was in the 90s, playing **Super Nintendo games** on emulators. I improved my typing speed by chatting with other players in online games. I even tried formal typing classes later, but I couldn’t unlearn my unique typing style. Who knows? Maybe if I’d started those classes earlier, I’d be an even faster typist now!
