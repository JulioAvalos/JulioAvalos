### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Julio, I'm a software engineer with over +9 years of experience! 

I've been in the IT sector for a couple of years, back then when I started my journey in this fast-paced industry I decided to make this Github account to keep a large repository to have my projects with which I've learned to use web technologies and that serve me as a library to remember some software implementations I did previously or have templates to start new projects from scratch.

A little bit about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with Angular but I'm well versed working with React.js/Next.js!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Full Stack projects using Node.js, React, Next.js, or Java/Spring Boot 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can contact me through linkedin, the link is at the top of my profile or just hit me up with a email!
- âš¡ Fun fact: When I had my first approach to a computer in the 90s, I learned to use it while playing super nintendo with emulators. And then I improved my typing speed while playing online games and typing simultaneously in chat with other players. I tried to take formal typing classes on my own, but I couldn't unlearn the way I used it, maybe if I had taken them in the beginning, I would be even faster at programming.
