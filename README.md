### Hi there 👋

I'm Julio! 

I've been a couple of years in the IT industry, I made this Github repository in order to have projects with which I have learned to use web technologies and that serve me as a library to remember some software implementations I did previously or have templates to start new projects from scratch.

A little bit about me:

- 🔭 I’m currently working with Angular (honestly I prefer React.js more).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Node.js
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Full Stack projects using Node.js + React (Solidity and Rust are still welcome!)
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me through linkedin, the link is at the top of my profile!
⚡ Fun fact: When I had my first approach to a computer in the 90s, I learned to use it while playing super nintendo with emulators. 
And then I improved my typing speed while playing online games and typing simultaneously in chat with other players.

I tried to take formal typing classes on my own, but I couldn't unlearn the way I used it, maybe if I had taken them in the beginning, I would be even faster at programming, lol
